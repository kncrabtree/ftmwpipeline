The machine contract
====================

A script, notebook helper or front end sometimes needs more than a human does:
a guarantee that a name, a field or a code will still be there next release,
and a way to branch on a condition without reading text. The **machine
contract** is that guarantee. It is the same surface interactive users already
have, exposed identically through the Python API, the ``Pipeline`` class and the
command line, with the extra promises a program needs. Anything not listed in
the contract -- log wording, exception message text, the layout of the
``.ftmw`` file, anything under ``ftmwpipeline._internal`` -- may change without
notice.

.. note::

   Before ``1.0.0`` the contract may still change incompatibly. The contract
   version below is ``0`` until it is announced.

The contract version
--------------------

``ftmwpipeline.CONTRACT_VERSION`` is a single integer. Gate on it, never on
``__version__``::

    import ftmwpipeline
    if ftmwpipeline.CONTRACT_VERSION < 1:
        raise RuntimeError("needs a newer ftmwpipeline")

Additions (a new accessor, field or code) raise the version and never break an
existing field. Every machine-readable payload also carries a **schema name**
of the form ``ftmw/<payload>@<n>``; a schema name never changes meaning.

Discovering what is offered: ``capabilities``
---------------------------------------------

``capabilities()`` returns the version and everything the installation
declares. It needs no file and is the same on every interface:

.. code-block:: python

   import ftmwpipeline.api as ftmw
   from ftmwpipeline import Pipeline

   ftmw.capabilities()          # functional API
   Pipeline.capabilities()      # Pipeline class (static)

.. code-block:: console

   $ ftmwpipeline read capabilities --format json

The payload is ``{"schema": "ftmw/capabilities@1", "contract_version": int,
"schemas": [...], "accessors": [...], "codes": [...]}``. Every accessor listed
exists on the API, on ``Pipeline`` and as a ``read`` verb.

Missing values: ``Absent``
--------------------------

"No value" has two distinct meanings, and the contract never confuses them with
``None``, ``nan``, ``-1`` or an empty string:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 30 30

   * - Meaning
     - Python
     - JSON
     - Array column
   * - present
     - the value
     - the value
     - value, status ``0``
   * - **not run** (never computed or tested in this file)
     - ``Absent.NOT_RUN``
     - ``null`` plus ``"<field>_absent": "not_run"``
     - ``nan`` (or the column's fill), status ``1``
   * - **undefined** (computed, but has no value)
     - ``Absent.UNDEFINED``
     - ``null`` plus ``"<field>_absent": "undefined"``
     - ``nan``, status ``2``

Compare with ``is``: ``x is Absent.NOT_RUN``. On the wire a field keeps one type
(its value type or ``null``); the sibling key appears only when the value is
absent. Array columns that can be absent come with a ``uint8`` column named
``<column>__status``. A setting that is merely unset reads as ``None``; that is
not an absent value.

Typed errors
------------

Every refusal a program may need to route on is a member of the exception
family rooted at :class:`~ftmwpipeline.file_manager.PipelineFileError`. Each
carries a stable ``code`` and typed attributes, and ``to_dict()`` returns::

    {"schema": "ftmw/error@1", "code": "not_found",
     "message": "...", "kind": "window", "ids": [4, 9]}

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 24 28 48

   * - Code
     - Exception
     - Extra fields
   * - ``stage_not_run``
     - ``StageDependencyError``
     - ``missing_dependencies``, ``command``
   * - ``not_found``
     - ``NotFoundError``
     - ``kind``, ``ids`` (every id the request named that does not exist)
   * - ``incomplete_provenance``
     - ``IncompleteProvenanceError``
     - ``missing``
   * - ``file_incompatible``
     - ``PipelineCompatibilityError``
     - ``file_version``, ``supported_version``
   * - ``file_corrupt``
     - ``PipelineCorruptionError``
     - none
   * - ``epoch_mismatch``
     - ``AnalysisEpochMismatchError``
     - ``file_epoch``, ``current_epoch``
   * - ``file_exists``
     - ``PipelineExistsError``
     - none

Route on ``code`` (or the class); the ``message`` text is for people. Each typed
error is still a subclass of the built-in it replaced (most are
``ValueError``; ``NotFoundError`` is a ``KeyError``), so existing ``except``
clauses keep working.

JSON from the command line
--------------------------

The contract accessors under ``ftmwpipeline read`` (such as ``read
capabilities``) take ``--format json`` (the only, and default, format),
``-o/--output DIR`` and ``-v``.

* The result is printed to stdout as JSON that is always strictly valid:
  non-finite floats are the strings ``"nan"``, ``"inf"`` and ``"-inf"``.
* An array-valued field is written to ``DIR`` as a ``.npy`` file (dtype, shape
  and byte order are self-describing) and the JSON names the file in its
  place. Asking for an array result without ``--output`` is an error.
* A contract error is printed to **stderr** as its ``to_dict()`` JSON, and the
  process exits with a code derived from the error code: ``2`` for
  ``file_corrupt``, ``1`` for every other code.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ftmwpipeline read capabilities | python -m json.tool

Python code can produce the same JSON with
:func:`ftmwpipeline.to_jsonable`, which applies the ``Absent`` rule, stamps a
``schema=`` name, and can hand arrays to a sink instead of inlining them.

The reference for every name is in :doc:`api/index`.
